# javascript and classes:
# yes but protortype based
# it is single threaded
# synchronous
# made asynchronous
# prototype-based language

# OOP

## Object: collection of properties and methods such as toLowerCase

## why use OOP? to reduce mess of code.

## Parts of OOP:
Object literal: object le rha hu

- Constructor function
-Prototypes:: js default prototype language hai. yahin se new, this and classes mili hain
-classes
-Instances (new,this)

## 4 Pillars
1. Abstraction :focusses on hiding complexity and showing only essential features such as fetch.
2. Encapsulation: it is bundling of data and methods into a single unit called class. restricts access to some object's component
3. Inheritance: enables one class to inherit properties and behaviours from other
4. Polymorphism: having many forms. 7 methods are defined in multiple classes and each method perform diff implementation based on object that invokes it. eg->console.log



### call(this,userrname)
### extends,super
### bind(this)
### new
## prototype
## Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor
### Object.defineProperty

## lexical scoping : means inner function can access outer function variables but functiuon ke bahar se variables access nhi kr sakte. Parent se kuch bhi access kr sakte but brthers mein accessible nhi hota aur outer ke pass bhi nhi hota

/////// outer ka inner ke pass access hai bsss
